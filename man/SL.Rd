solution. Only needs to be specified if a pattern matrix is entered directly
into \code{x}.}

This is used to control the procedure of the second-order factor analysis. See

principal axis factoring, maximum likelihood, or unweighted least squares
(also called minres), respectively, used in \code{\link{EFA}} to find the second-order
loadings.}

\description{
This function implements the Schmid-Leiman (SL) transformation
(Schmid & Leiman, 1957). It takes the pattern coefficients and factor
intercorrelations from an oblique factor solution as
input and can reproduce the results from \code{\link[psych:schmid]{psych::schmid}}
and from the SPSS implementation from Wolff & Preising (2005). Other arguments
from \code{\link{EFA}} can be used to control
the procedure to find the second-order loadings more flexibly.
}
\details{
The SL transformation (also called SL orthogonalization) is a procedure with
which an oblique factor solution is transformed into a hierarchical,
orthogonalized solution. As a first step, the factor intercorrelations are
again factor analyzed to find second-order factor loadings. If there is only
one higher-order factor, this step of the procedure stops there, resulting in
a second-order factor structure. The first-order factor and the second-order
factor are then orthogonalized, resulting in an orthogonalized factor solution
with proportionality constraints. The procedure thus makes a suggested
hierarchical data structure based on factor intercorrelations explicit. One
major advantage of SL transformation is that it enables variance
partitioning between higher-order and first-order factors, including the
calculation of McDonald's omegas (see \code{\link{OMEGA}}).

\examples{
## Use with an output from the EFAtools::EFA function, both with type EFAtools
EFA_mod <- EFA(test_models$baseline$cormat, N = 500, n_factors = 3,
               type = "EFAtools", method = "PAF", rotation = "promax")
SL_EFAtools <- SL(EFA_mod, type = "EFAtools", method = "PAF")

\donttest{
## Use with an output from the psych::fa function with type psych in SL
fa_mod <- psych::fa(test_models$baseline$cormat, nfactors = 3, n.obs = 500,
                    fm = "pa", rotate = "Promax")
SL_psych <- SL(fa_mod, type = "psych", method = "PAF")
}

## Use more flexibly by entering a pattern matrix and phi directly (useful if
## a factor solution found with another program should be subjected to SL
## transformation)

## For demonstration, take pattern matrix and phi from an EFA output
## This gives the same solution as the first example
EFA_mod <- EFA(test_models$baseline$cormat, N = 500, n_factors = 3,
               type = "EFAtools", method = "PAF", rotation = "promax")
SL_flex <- SL(EFA_mod$rot_loadings, Phi = EFA_mod$Phi, type = "EFAtools",
              method = "PAF")
